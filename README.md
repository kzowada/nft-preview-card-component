## My process

My process was the same as with my challenges that I did before. First I thought about the inital layout of this challenge and made a rough blueprint of it on a whiteboard. Then I typed the HTML into my Editor. After that I just simply started styling Element after Element with CSS and trying to get the Design right. The colors of the box-shadows are the wrong colors but I couldn't find out how to match the colors from the Design and the provided style-guide wasn't showimg them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was actually the first time that I've used the box-shadow property by myself. I'm trying to build on that and from now on implement my own shadows.
